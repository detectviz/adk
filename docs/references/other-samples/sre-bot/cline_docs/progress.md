# Progress for SRE Assistant Agent

## What Works

1. **Core Agent Framework**: The basic agent structure is set up with Google ADK.
   - Root agent configuration
   - SRE agent with Gemini model integration
   - Kubernetes sub-agent with specialized tools
   - Integrated with litellm for proprietary model support
   - Support for Anthropic Claude model

2. **Kubernetes Tools**: A comprehensive set of Kubernetes interaction tools have been implemented:
   - Listing resources (namespaces, deployments, pods, services, etc.)
   - Getting detailed information about resources
   - Scaling deployments
   - Retrieving pod logs
   - Checking resource health
   - Retrieving Kubernetes events

3. **Utility Functions**: Basic utility functions for loading instructions from files.

4. **Containerization**: 
   - Dockerfile for building the application container
   - Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment
   - Container-specific configuration and environment setup
   - Multiple services (web interface, API server, Slack bot)

5. **Slack Integration**:
   - Slack bot for interacting with the SRE agent
   - Message handling and threading support
   - API communication between the Slack bot and SRE agent

## What's Left to Build

1. **Additional Tool Modules**:
   - Monitoring system integration (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog)
   - Log aggregation system integration
   - Additional cloud provider-specific tools (GCP, Azure)
   - Incident management system integration

2. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Detailed API documentation
   - More usage examples
   - Deployment guides for production environments
   - Troubleshooting information

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for tools and utilities
   - Integration tests for the agent
   - End-to-end testing with a Kubernetes cluster

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure credential management
   - Audit logging

## Recent Updates

1. **Dependencies Management**:
   - Added litellm>=1.63.11 for proprietary model integration
   - Added boto3 support for AWS services and Bedrock models
   - Fixed dependency-related container build issues

2. **Inter-service Communication**:
   - Improved error handling for API timeouts
   - Added diagnostic tools for containerized services
   - Enhanced documentation for service connectivity troubleshooting

3. **Slack Bot Improvements**:
   - Better error handling for API communication
   - Documentation for setup and configuration

## Progress Status

The project has moved beyond early development and now has working containerized services including a web interface, API server, and Slack bot integration. Core Kubernetes functionality is implemented and working. Current focus is on stabilizing inter-service communication, enhancing documentation, and preparing for additional integrations.
