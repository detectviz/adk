# Product Context for SRE Assistant Agent

## Why This Project Exists

The SRE Assistant Agent was created to help Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) with operational tasks and monitoring through natural language conversations. It aims to:

1. Reduce the cognitive load on SREs by automating routine operational tasks
2. Provide quick access to system information without requiring knowledge of specific CLI commands
3. Streamline incident response by offering a conversational interface to monitoring and operational tools
4. Make Kubernetes operations more accessible through natural language queries

## Problems It Solves

1. **Operational Complexity**: Kubernetes environments can be complex to navigate and monitor. This agent simplifies interactions with Kubernetes clusters.
2. **Tool Fragmentation**: SREs often need to use multiple tools and interfaces. This agent provides a unified interface.
3. **Knowledge Barriers**: New team members may not be familiar with all the commands and tools. The agent lowers this barrier.
4. **Response Time**: During incidents, quick access to information is critical. The agent helps retrieve information faster.

## How It Should Work

The SRE Assistant Agent should:

1. Accept natural language queries about Kubernetes resources and operations
2. Translate these queries into appropriate Kubernetes API calls
3. Return formatted, human-readable responses
4. Provide actionable insights based on the retrieved information
5. Support common SRE tasks like checking service status, retrieving logs, and scaling deployments
6. Integrate with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and leverage the Gemini model for natural language understanding
