# Active Context for SRE Assistant Agent

## Current Task

We are currently working on containerizing the SRE Assistant Agent by creating:

1. A Dockerfile to package the application
2. A docker-compose.yml file to simplify deployment and configuration

## Recent Changes

No recent changes have been made to the codebase. The project is in its initial state with the following components:

- Main agent implementation in `main/agent.py`
- Kubernetes tools in `main/tools/kube_tools.py`
- Utility functions in `main/utils.py`
- Basic project structure and documentation

## Next Steps

1. Create a Dockerfile that:
   - Uses an appropriate Python base image
   - Installs all required dependencies
   - Sets up the application environment
   - Configures the entry point for running the agent

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file that:
   - Defines the service for the SRE Assistant Agent
   - Configures environment variables
   - Sets up volume mounts for Kubernetes configuration
   - Exposes necessary ports

3. Test the containerized application to ensure it works correctly

4. Update documentation to include instructions for running the application with Docker
