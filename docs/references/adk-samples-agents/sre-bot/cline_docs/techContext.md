# Technical Context for SRE Assistant Agent

## Technologies Used

1. **Python 3.10+**: The core programming language used for the application.

2. **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: Framework for building conversational agents with Google's Gemini models.

3. **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: The large language model used for natural language understanding and generation.

4. **Kubernetes Python Client**: Official Kubernetes client library for Python, used to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

5. **Python-dateutil**: Library for manipulating dates and times in Python.

## Development Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**: The project uses Python's virtual environment for dependency isolation.

2. **API Keys**: Requires a Google API key for Gemini access.

3. **Kubernetes Configuration**: Uses the default Kubernetes configuration from the user's environment.

4. **Package Management**: Dependencies are managed through pip and requirements.txt.

## Technical Constraints

1. **Kubernetes Access**: The agent needs access to a Kubernetes cluster and appropriate permissions to perform operations.

2. **API Rate Limits**: Google Gemini API has rate limits that need to be considered for production use.

3. **Authentication**: The agent inherits Kubernetes authentication from the environment it runs in.

4. **Resource Requirements**: The application requires sufficient memory for running the Python interpreter and processing responses from the Gemini model.

5. **Network Access**: Requires network access to both the Google API and the Kubernetes API server.

6. **Security Considerations**: 
   - The agent should follow the principle of least privilege when accessing Kubernetes resources.
   - API keys and credentials should be securely managed.
   - Care should be taken when exposing the agent's API to prevent unauthorized access.
